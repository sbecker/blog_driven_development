BlogDrivenDevelopment.com

This is an experiment to blog about building a blog,
using current ruby/rails best practices.

Authors:
 - Brian Artiaco
 - Scott Becker

The Goals:
 - Build a blog, using rails and current best-practices
 - Dogfood all the way - posts for blog will be on the blog we build
 - Learn how to use cucumber to drive development
 - Get better at pair programming
 - Practice full integration of Story Driven Development

 - Tools we plan to use:
   - Cucumber stories
   - Rspec + Shoulda?
   - Factorygirl or Machinist (perhaps that should be a post)
   - Compass (+ haml & sass)
   - Github - open source
   - Integrity? (continuous integration)
   - Heroku? too much at once - maybe later? Maybe that will be a side experiment at some point
